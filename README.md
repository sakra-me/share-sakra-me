### Hello and welcome ðŸ‘‹

In this repo, I would like for the community to pull together to design and build a static file and secret sharing app - that can be hosted via the likes of Vercel, Netlify or similar.

A roadmap of sorts as a starter, could be:

- [ ] Website design
- [ ] S3 capatability for the sharing of files
- [ ] Use of Neon DB for sharing of "secrets" or XATA
- [ ] User authentication, whereby that user is the **only** one that see's their shares
- [ ] More to be added soon... 

Let's see what we can all build, together.
